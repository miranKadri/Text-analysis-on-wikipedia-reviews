        "Improve Offline Page Management: The reviews above, 1st Bug Review to be more specific, highlighted issues with accidentally deleting offline pages, suggesting a need for better management and confirmation prompts before deletion. This change would enhance user experience by reducing accidental data loss and providing a more robust offline usage feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "Optimize Table Navigation and UI Responsiveness: Users have reported, 2nd Bug Review to be more specific, difficulties with navigating tables and UI elements, especially on smaller screens. Improving table rendering and touch sensitivity would enhance the app's usability and accessibility.\n",

They are more about \"what users want\" or \"what problems users face\" rather than what users generally discuss. The accuracy of the models and the amount of data they are trained on affect these insights. LDA can work with large datasets to find general patterns, while classifiers need specific labeled data to identify precise feedback types.\n",
